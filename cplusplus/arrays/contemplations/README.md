# Contemplations

### Crux 00:
integers, a and b (obtained by the user) and will perform the division a/b, store the result in another integer c and show the result of the division using cout. In a similar way, extend the program to add, subtract, multiply, do modulo and power using integers a and b. Modify your program so that when it starts, it asks the user which type of calculation it should do, then asks for the 2 integers, then runs the user selected calculation and outputs the result in a user friendly formatted manner.

### Crux 01:
Create an array that can hold ten integers, and get input from user. Display those values on the screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. Search through the array, and count the number of times the item is found.

### Crux 02:
Write a program that asks for an index and a number. Then it includes the number at the indicated index of the array ={1,2,3,4,5,6} and moves a position forward (from u to u+1) each element after the selected index.

### Crux 03:
Write a program that reverses a string and prints it on the screen.

### Precedent 00:
A Program to Store pre initilized value in three dimensional array and display it.

### Precedent 00a:
A Program to Store value entered by user(take input from users) in three dimensional array and display it.
