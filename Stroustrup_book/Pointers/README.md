# Common mistakes when working with pointers

### Suppose, we want a pointer varPoint to point to the address of var. Then,

```c++
int var, *varPoint;

// Wrong! 
// varPoint is an address but var is not
varPoint = var;

// Wrong!
// &var is an address
// *varPoint is the value stored in &var
*varPoint = &var;

// Correct! 
// varPoint is an address and so is &var
varPoint = &var;

 // Correct!
// both *varPoint and var are values
*varPoint = var;
```
