Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code. Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.

### Single-line Comments
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

Example
```c++
// This is a comment
cout << "Hello World!";
```

This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:

Example
```cpp
cout << "Hello World!"; // This is a comment
```
