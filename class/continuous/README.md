### Operators
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. 

Operators are the foundation of any programming language. We can define operators as symbols that help us to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands.

Operators in C++ can be classified into 6 types:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Other Operators
