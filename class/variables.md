# Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values. There are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

- int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
- string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
- bool - stores values with two states: true or false
